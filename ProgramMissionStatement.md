### Applied Data Science Program: Leveraging AI for Effective Decision-Making

### MISSION STATEMENT:
Data is getting created at a rapid pace. It is estimated that more than 2 quintillion bytes of data have been created each day in the last two years. As organizations experience an overflow of data, they are sparing no effort to extract meaningful insights to make smarter business decisions. In order to help unravel the true worth of data, the MIT Professional Education Applied Data Science Program provides a strong foundation to help become an analyst in this area. In this 12-week program, the main achievements include being able to upgrade data analytics skills by learning the theory and practical application of supervised and unsupervised learning, time-series analysis, neural networks, recommendation engines, regression, and computer vision, in addition to some others. Moreover, the program offers a focus on AI and ML-based projects and case studies, providing one with real-world applications and experiences in utilizing AI for data-driven decision-making. Throughout the program, there is emphasis on developing a strong understanding of how Python is used to apply Data Science.

Upon successful fulfillment of all requirements, a Certificate of Completion from MIT Professional Education will be awarded.

Additional expertise can be obtained with the completion of complimentary course certifications in:
 - Introduction to Model Deployment
 - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence on Cloud
